  {\bf File System-Integrated Search and Discovery Services for High Performance Computing}
   {\it \footnotesize --- 2015-2016, Virginia Tech and Oak Ridge National Laboratory}
   \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.02in}
    \item[-] Developed a file system-integrated metadata indexing framework
	     that supports a user-defined tagging.
    \item[-] Developed a command-line utility that allows to run interactive file search queries
             in SQL.
    \item[-] Developed a computation offloading framework via a tagging-based file search,
             similar to `\fixed{find -exec}'.
    \item[-] Developed an automatic metadata
	     extraction framework based on the tagging-based file search.
    %\item[-] Implemented the prototype framework in GlusterFS and command-line utilities.

  {\bf Exploiting Active Flash devices in High Performance Computing Storage}
    {\it \footnotesize --- 2013-2015, Virginia Tech and Oak Ridge National Laboratory}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.02in}
    \item[-] Developed an active storage target framework based on SCSI T10 OSD-2
    specification.
    \item[-] Enhanced OSD initiator driver and exofs in Linux Kernel to support the active
    processing.
    \item[-] Designed and developed a FUSE file system that manages an array of active OSD devices.
    \item[-] Developed a workflow manager within the file system to orchestrate scientific
    workflow tasks across an array of active OSD devices.
    \item[-] Developed a provenance management framework with a light-weight database
             within the file system.
    \item[] {\small(Linux Kernel, SCSI T10 OSD-2 Protocol, Linux TGT, FUSE, SQLite)}

    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.02in}
    \item[-] Developed a content server log analyzer to analyze content popularity
             of a commercial media server.
    \item[-] Developed a stripped-down file system based on ext2
             for storage class memory devices, i.e., PRAM.
    \item[] {\small(Linux Kernel, Windows Media Server)}

  {\bf Design of a NAND Flash Memory-Based File System Supporting Transaction and
      Record Structure} 
    {\it \footnotesize --- 2006-2008, Database Lab., Hanyang University}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.02in}
    \item[-] Developed a framework to identify FTL mapping schemes of NAND flash memory-based
             storage devices.
    \item[-] Developed a DBMS that directly manages a raw NAND flash memory chip
             for managing EPG (Electronic Program Guide) data in a set top box.
    \item[-] Developed a buffer management policy in PostgreSQL for NAND flash
             memory-based storage devices.
    \item[] {\small(Linux Kernel, Linux MTD, Wisconsin Storage System, ARM-based embedded
     board, PostgreSQL)}
