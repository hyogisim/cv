  {\bf File System-Integrated Search and Discovery Services for High Performance Computing}
   {\it \footnotesize --- 2015-2016, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Virginia Tech}
   \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.02in}
    \item[-] Designed and developed a file system-integrated metadata indexing framework
	     that supports a user-defined tagging in GlusterFS.
    \item[-] Developed a command-line utility with the GlusterFS API to
             allow interactive, tagging-based file search queries in SQL syntax.
    \item[-] Developed a computation offloading framework via a tagging-based file search,
             similar to `\fixed{find -exec}'.
    \item[-] Developed an automatic metadata
	     extraction framework based on the tagging-based file search.
    %\item[-] Implemented the prototype framework in GlusterFS and command-line utilities.

  {\bf Analysis-Aware Storage System for High Performance Computing}
    {\it \footnotesize --- 2013-2015, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Virginia Tech}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.02in}
    \item[-] Developed an active code execution framework on the Linux TGT implementation
             based on the extended SCSI T10 OSD-2 specification.
    \item[-] Extended the OSD initiator driver and exofs in Linux Kernel to support the active
             processing.
    \item[-] Designed and developed a FUSE file system that manages
             the array of active OSD devices.
    \item[-] Integrated a workflow manager within the file system to schedule scientific
    workflow tasks across the array of active OSD devices.
    \item[-] Developed a provenance management framework based on the OSD-2 object abstraction
             and the database integration in the FUSE file system.
             %with a light-weight database within the file system.
    \item[] {\small(Linux Kernel, SCSI T10 OSD-2 Protocol, Linux TGT, FUSE, SQLite)}

  {\bf Managing Multimedia Data for Content Servers with Hybrid Storage Architecture}
    {\it \footnotesize --- 2007-2009, Database Lab., Hanyang University}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.02in}
    \item[-] Developed a content server log analyzer to analyze content popularity
             of a commercial media server.
    \item[-] Developed a stripped-down file system based on ext2
             for storage class memory devices, i.e., PRAM.
    \item[] {\small(Linux Kernel, Windows Media Server)}

  {\bf Design of a NAND Flash Memory-Based File System Supporting Transaction and
      Record Structure} 
    {\it \footnotesize --- 2006-2008, Database Lab., Hanyang University}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.02in}
    \item[-] Developed a framework to identify FTL mapping schemes of NAND flash memory-based
             storage devices.
    \item[-] Developed a DBMS that directly manages a raw NAND flash memory chip
             for managing EPG (Electronic Program Guide) data in a set top box.
    \item[-] Developed a buffer management policy in PostgreSQL for NAND flash
             memory-based storage devices.
    \item[] {\small(Linux Kernel, Linux MTD, Wisconsin Storage System, ARM-based embedded
     board, PostgreSQL)}
